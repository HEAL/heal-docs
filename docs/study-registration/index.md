# Study Registration

!!! success "Registering Your Study"
    
    Registering your study is a simple, three-step process:
    
    1. Request access to register your study.
    2. Create a CEDAR account, if you do not already have one.
    3. Register your study on the HEAL Data Platform. 
    After completing registration, the next step will be completing your metadata form in CEDAR.

## Overview

The HEAL Data Platform provides a single interface where users can browse and
search for all HEAL-funded studies as well as other HEAL-relevant datasets. In
this way, the Platform plays a fundamental role in making HEAL data *findable*
as part of adhering to the FAIR data principles (i.e., data should be
Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable).

To achieve this goal, the platform aggregates metadata about each study from
multiple sources. One of these is [NIH RePORTER](https://reporter.nih.gov)
from which basic information about all HEAL-funded studies is automatically
obtained. However, there are three additional sources of metadata which the
Platform can utilize:

* Information entered into the
  [Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval (CEDAR) Workbench](http://cedar.metadatacenter.org/),
  an online platform for creating and managing metadata according to the FAIR
  principles
* Information from [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov) for
  those clinical studies registered there
* Information from the data repository to which the study is submitting its
  data

To permit the Platform to pull information from these sources, a study must be
*registered*. Registration is the process of linking a study to one or more of
the metadata/data sources listed above. This process can be performed by the
Principal Investigator or another member of the research team.

!!! question "What if I'm not ready to submit data yet?"

    You may register your study at any time, even if you are not yet ready to
    submit data to a repository. Registering your study increases its
    visibility on the Platform and allows the Platform and data repository to
    anticipate and plan for your subsequent data submission.

      Regardless of whether I'm a data-savvy researcher, patient, clinician, economist, or policy-maker, whether I come from a focus on pain or opioid conditions, **study level metadata** enables quick and easy search and discovery for studies that might be producing datasets or findings of relevance (even before the study has started or data has been produced).

      **CEDAR** is an interactive form that allows investigators to fill out study-level metadata not available from existing linked sources (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov). It provides sets of controlled vocabulary, making the process easier on the investigator.


??? success "A ClinicalTrials.gov identifier (if applicable)"

      We know that investigators already provide study metadata to other sources (e.g. the NIH during the award application process, to **ClinicalTrials.gov** during the study registration process if the study is a reportable clinical trial). During the study registration process, investigators will provide links to these sources of existing metadata. The Platform will harvest this metadata, and use as much as possible to fulfill the HEAL Study-level Core Metadata requirements. Investigators will only be asked to provide the balance of metadata that cannot be harvested from existing sources.
