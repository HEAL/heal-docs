# Study-Level Metadata Submission

## Next Steps: Fill out your CEDAR form  

The act of submitting the study registration form will result in the creation of a metadata input
form within your CEDAR account:

- Find the form for your study under the Shared with Me folder on CEDAR
  (accessible in the left-hand navigation).
- When you enter additional data into the CEDAR form, be sure to SAVE your
  changes by scrolling to the bottom of the form.
- The HEAL Data Platform will pull entries from the CEDAR templates into the
  Platform to enhance search capabilities and provide increasingly robust
  study details.
- Detailed guidance for completing the CEDAR metadata form can be found [here](https://heal.github.io/cedar-form-docs/).
